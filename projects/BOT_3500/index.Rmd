## **Abstract**

**Does Greater Phylogenetic Distance Affect Competition Outcomes in Fungal Communities?**

Annette Lewis, Kendall Holcomb, Bárbara Suassuna Schincariol, Josh Stubbs, Geoffery Zahn PhD

Fungi play a critical role in decomposition, affecting nutrient cycling at a global scale. Saprotrophic fungi competitively decompose dead organic matter. However, the role of phylogenetic relatedness on interspecific competition in fungal communities has not received much attention. The theory of phylogenetic over-dispersion suggests that species within a community tend to be less related than expected by chance, therefore limiting competition due to functional redundancy. Similarly, Darwin’s naturalization hypothesis suggests that taxonomically distinct invaders might experience reduced competition and resistance. In this study, we chose three different saprotrophic fungal species with varying relatedness: *Aspergillus niger* and *Fusarium keratoplasticum* (from the same family), and *Pleurotus ostreatus* (from a different phylum). These species were chosen based on decomposition abilities and phylogenetic distances. These species were cultured and placed in seven combinations to assess their ability to decompose and compete as individual fungal populations and as combined communities (e.g., A, B, A+B, B+C, and A+B+C). Each species was placed near a sterilized piece of paper such that competition was evaluated by analyzing the paper coverage in Petri dishes over three weeks. Each Petri dish was analyzed individually based on the average percentage of paper covered and, within combined communities, the percentage of paper each species covered. Interactions between each species and the percentage of the paper covered was recorded for further analysis. Assessing paper coverage allows for the observation of any potential competitive inhibition of decomposition. We hypothesize that decomposing and competitive abilities would be the strongest with *A. niger*. Despite the fast growth rate of *A. niger* individually, preliminary results suggest that it was outcompeted when paired with other species. This research highlights the potential nuances in fungal community interactions influenced by phylogenetic relationships, shedding light on the principles of phylogenetic overdispersion and Darwin’s naturalization hypothesis.

## **Methods**

We used three saprophytic fungal species *Aspergillus niger*, *Fusarium keratoplasticum*, and *Pleurotus ostreatus*. *A. niger* and *F. keratoplasticum* will be purchased from ATCC.org as freeze-dried and frozen samples. *P. ostreatus* was already available from Dr. Zahn’s laboratory. These fungal species will then be cultured in Petri dishes.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("./Screenshot 2023-10-01 at 9.35.22 PM.png")
```

The cultured fungal samples will be placed in **7 combinations** to test their ability to decompose as individual fungi populations and combined communities. For each of the combinations, there will be six replicates. 

*The sterilized paper's dimensions are: 1in by 1in*

Alongside our results, we will obtain genetic information based on the ITS1 gene in GenBank and construct a phylogenetic tree. We will calculate the phylogenetic relatedness of our species via branch length distance, using ape 5.0 in R. This portion of the research will be conducted to observe species' phylogenetic diversity and decomposition abilities.

### **Phylogenetic tree**

Initial phylogenetic tree setup. The sequences were obtained from the NCBI, based on the ITS region, and aligned using the EMBL-EBI's Multiple Sequence Alignment tool, MUSCLE. This tree has no outgroup selected and serves to show the most basic form of this tree.

```{r}
alignment_file <- "./3_muscle_alignment.fasta"
fungi <- read.phyDat(alignment_file, format = "fasta")
dist_matrix <- dist.ml(fungi, model = "JC69")
nj_tree <- nj(dist_matrix)
# Extract species names from the tip labels
species_names <- sapply(strsplit(nj_tree$tip.label, " "), function(x) paste(x[1:2], collapse = " "))

# Update the labels of the rooted tree
nj_tree$tip.label <- species_names

# Replace these placeholders with the actual species names in the same order as your tip labels
species_names <- c(
  "Aspergillus niger",
  "Fusarium keratoplasticum",
  "Pleurotus ostreatus",
  "Pericharax heteroraphis"
)
nj_tree$tip.label <- species_names
outgroup_name <- "Pericharax heteroraphis"
outgroup_index <- which(nj_tree$tip.label == outgroup_name)
nj_tree_rooted <- root(nj_tree, outgroup_index)
```

Phylogenetic tree rooted on *Pericharax heteroraphis*, a sea sponge, including species names.

```{r}
plot(nj_tree_rooted)
```

## **Combinations**

The different combinations we plan to test:

```{r, include = TRUE, message = TRUE}
# Test for different combinations
species_combinations <- list(
  "Aspergillus niger", #A
  "Fusarium keratoplasticum", #B
  "Pleurotus ostreatus", #C
  c("Aspergillus niger", "Fusarium keratoplasticum"), #A+B
  c("Aspergillus niger", "Pleurotus ostreatus"), #A+C
  c("Fusarium keratoplasticum", "Pleurotus ostreatus"), #B+C
  c("Aspergillus niger", "Fusarium keratoplasticum", "Pleurotus ostreatus") #A+B+C
)

df <- data.frame(
  Species =  c("Aspergillus niger", #A
  "Fusarium keratoplasticum", #B
  "Pleurotus ostreatus", #C
  "Aspergillus niger and Fusarium keratoplasticum", #A+B
  "Aspergillus niger and Pleurotus ostreatus", #A+C
  "Fusarium keratoplasticum and Pleurotus ostreatus", #B+C
  "Aspergillus niger, Fusarium keratoplasticum, and Pleurotus ostreatus"), #A+B+C 
  Combination = c("A", "B", "C", "A+B", "A+C", "B+C", "A+B+C")
)

df %>% kable() %>% 
  kable_classic(lightable_options = "hover") %>%
  scroll_box(height = "200px")
```

## **Branch lengths**

```{r}
# Function to calculate branch lengths based on the sea sponge
compute_branch_length <- function(species_combination, nj_tree_rooted, outgroup) {
  species_to_keep <- union(species_combination, outgroup)
  sub_tree <- drop.tip(nj_tree_rooted, setdiff(nj_tree_rooted$tip.label, species_to_keep))
  sub_tree <- drop.tip(sub_tree, outgroup)
  sum(sub_tree$edge.length)
}

# Function to calculate branch lengths (general)
compute_branch_length_gen <- function(species_combination, nj_tree_rooted, outgroup) {
   species_to_keep <- union(species_combination, outgroup)
   sub_tree <- drop.tip(nj_tree_rooted, setdiff(nj_tree_rooted$tip.label, species_to_keep))
   return(sum(sub_tree$edge.length))
}
```

```{r}
results <- sapply(species_combinations, FUN = compute_branch_length, nj_tree_rooted = nj_tree_rooted, outgroup = outgroup_name)

species_combinations_str <- sapply(species_combinations, function(x) paste(x, collapse=", "))

results_gen <- sapply(species_combinations, FUN = compute_branch_length_gen, nj_tree_rooted = nj_tree_rooted, outgroup = outgroup_name)
```

**Main**. Compute branch lengths based on our sea sponge, *Pleurotus ostreatus*. In this, the branch lengths associated with the outgroup are excluded here after using it to root the tree.

```{r}
results_tbl <- tibble(Species=species_combinations_str, Combination=df$Combination, Branch_Length=results)
# Table with branch lengths where branch lengths associated with the outgroup "Pericharax heteroraphis" were removed
results_tbl %>% kable() %>%
  kable_classic(lightable_options = "hover") %>%
  scroll_box(height = "200px")
summary(results_tbl$Branch_Length)
sd(results_tbl$Branch_Length)
```

<br>

**General**. Below shows the general branch length values where the outgroup's branch length is kept in the final calculation.

```{r}
results_gen_tbl <- tibble(Species=species_combinations_str, Combination=df$Combination, Branch_Length=results_gen)
# Table with branch lengths based on the outgroup "Pericharax heteroraphis"
results_gen_tbl %>% 
  kable() %>%
  kable_classic(lightable_options = "hover") %>%
  scroll_box(height = "200px")
summary(results_gen_tbl$Branch_Length)
sd(results_gen_tbl$Branch_Length)
```

*Our plan will be to stick with this one as the branch lengths here have a slightly larger standard deviation, but this difference is negligible*

## **Experimental results**
This project will be continued, I will add updates when possible!

General Results: 

```{r}
new <- data.frame(
  Species =  c("Aspergillus niger", #A
  "Fusarium keratoplasticum", #B

  "Fusarium keratoplasticum and Pleurotus ostreatus", #B+C
  "Aspergillus niger, Fusarium keratoplasticum, and Pleurotus ostreatus"),
Species_short =  c("A. niger", #A
  "F. keratoplasticum", #B
  "P. ostreatus", #C
  "A. niger and F. keratoplasticum", #A+B
  "A. niger and P. ostreatus", #A+C
  "F. keratoplasticum and P. ostreatus", #B+C
  "A. niger, F. keratoplasticum, and P. ostreatus"))
merged_data <- merge(results_gen_tbl, new, by = "Species")

df <- results_gen_tbl %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(Combination, Branch_Length, increasing = TRUE), y = Branch_Length)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(title = "Branch length based on species combination",

                     color = "Combination",
                     shape = "Species")) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(face = "italic"))

ggplotly(df)

w1 <- df
```

Non plotly graph (showing same thing)

```{r}
results_tbl %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(Combination, Branch_Length, increasing = TRUE), y = Branch_Length)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(title = "Branch length based on species combination",
       x = "Species combination",
       y = "Branch length")
```

*NOTE:* This will be compared to the actual experimental setup.

```{r}
data <- read.csv("./Community_Diversity_Phylogeny_Decomposition - main_sheet.csv")
```

### Line plot over time:

```{r}
# Week numbers
data <- data %>%
  arrange(date) %>%
  mutate(week = paste("Week", dense_rank(date) - 1))

# Line plot over time:
time_series_data <- data %>%
  group_by(week, combinations, species) %>%
  summarise(mean_species_coverage = mean(species_coverage, na.rm = TRUE))

ggplot(time_series_data, aes(x = week, y = mean_species_coverage, color = combinations, linetype = species)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = interaction(combinations, species))) +
  ylim(0, 100) +
  labs(title = "Mean Species Coverage Over Time", y = "Mean Species Coverage (%)", x = "Week")
```

Another line plot, not including individual species

```{r}
# Line plot over time for combinations only:
time_series_combinations <- data %>%
  group_by(week, combinations) %>%
  summarise(mean_species_coverage = mean(species_coverage, na.rm = TRUE))

ggplot(time_series_combinations, aes(x = week, y = mean_species_coverage, color = combinations)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = combinations)) +
  ylim(0, 100) +
  labs(title = "Mean Species Coverage Over Time by Combinations", y = "Mean Species Coverage (%)", x = "Week")
```

### Comparison of coverage over time (highlighting individual species)

```{r}
# Now you can use the 'week' column in your ggplot2 plots
grouped_week_data <- data %>%
  group_by(week, combinations, species) %>%
  summarise(mean_species_coverage = mean(species_coverage, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  filter(week != "Week 0")

q1 <- ggplot(grouped_week_data, aes(x = combinations, y = mean_species_coverage, fill = species)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', position = 'dodge') +
  ylim(0, 100) +
  labs(y = "Mean Species Coverage (%)", x = "Combinations") +
  facet_wrap(~ week, ncol = 1)

Bond Length

```{r}

  ylim(0, 100) +
  labs(y = "Mean Species Coverage (%)", x = "Combinations") +

### Comparison of coverage over time (total)

This one needs fixing (it's set up by date)

```{r}

  summarise(mean_total_coverage = mean(total_coverage, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  filter(week != "Week 0")

r1 <- ggplot(grouped_week_data, aes(x = combinations, y = mean_total_coverage, fill = combinations)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', position = 'dodge') +
  ylim(0, 100) +
  labs(y = "Mean Total Coverage (%)", x = "Combinations") +

```

Bond Length
