Hi, My name is Annette! I am an upcoming biology graduate from Utah Valley University (UVU) with an expected completion date in December 2023. I am driven by a deep passion for scientific exploration and discovery. I take pride in my commitment to education, having achieved an early graduation from high school and successfully completed a two-year degree in University Studies at UVU in 2021.

My academic journey has fostered a strong foundation in data analysis, and I am proficient in utilizing RStudio for conducting research and analyzing complex biological data. I am eager to contribute my skills to biology projects that hold the potential to make a positive impact on society.

My aspirations lie in advancing biological research, unraveling the mysteries of the natural world, and applying scientific knowledge to improve human health and well-being. I believe that diversity drives innovation, and as a Latina scientist, I am dedicated to promoting inclusivity and collaboration within the scientific community.

Let's connect and explore new opportunities together! I am excited to contribute my expertise and continue my growth as a biologist and researcher.

```

### I can do coding things!

Here's the mpg dataset:
```{r message=FALSE, include=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra)
library(plotly)
mpg %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_classic(lightable_options = 'hover') %>% 
  scroll_box(width = "500px", height = "200px")

p <- mpg %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x= displ, y= cty)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
ggplotly(p)

round(mean(mpg$cty), 2)

```

The mean city miles per gallon is **`r round(mean(mpg$cty), 2)`** in this dataset
